# The-Beta-Method-Thesis
The final program for the beta method of iterated exponentials


To begin use of the program one must execute the file in a pari-gp shell.
We can now choose digit precision by taking "\p d" and series precision by "\ps count"


From here, one must call init(b,l); or init_OFF(b,l) if b > 1E6
